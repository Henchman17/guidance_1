# TODO: Clean up lib/settings.dart

## Information Gathered
- The file is a Flutter settings page widget with profile, preferences, notifications, credential requests, and privacy sections.
- It contains many unused methods (API service methods like _fetchAllUsers, _deleteUser, etc.) that belong in a separate service layer.
- Unused variables: _phoneController, _credentialRequests.
- Debug print statements throughout the code.
- Inconsistent handling of profile data: mixing SharedPreferences with API data.
- Profile fields are read-only but code attempts to save them to SharedPreferences.
- Long file with mixed concerns (UI and data fetching).

## Plan
- Remove unused imports, variables, and methods.
- Remove debug print statements.
- Clean up profile data handling: remove SharedPreferences saving/loading for read-only fields.
- Organize code: group related methods, improve readability.
- Ensure null safety and consistency.
- Keep only settings-related functionality; remove unrelated API methods.

## Dependent Files to be edited
- lib/settings.dart (main file to clean up)

## Followup steps
- Test the settings page functionality after cleanup.
- Consider extracting API methods to a separate service class if needed elsewhere.
- Verify navigation and UI still work correctly.
